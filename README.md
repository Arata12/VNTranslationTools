# VNTextPatch
A tool for extracting original text from, and patching translated text into, a variety of visual novel formats. Currently the following engines are supported:
* ArcGameEngine (.bin)
* CatSystem2 (.cst)
* CrimsonSystem (no file extension; tool expects .csa)
* Buriko General Interpreter/Ethornell (no file extension; tool expects .bgi)
* Kirikiri (.ks/.ks.scn)
* Propeller (.msc)
* RealLive (.rl)
* Ren'Py (.rpy)
* ShSystem (.hst)
* Qlie (.s)
* SystemNNN (.nnn)
* YU-RIS (.ybn)

The tool can extract text into Excel spreadsheets (.xlsx), and reinsert text from Excel or Google Docs spreadsheets. Reinserting from Google Docs requires an API key in VNTextPatch.exe.config; in addition, the spreadsheet should be publically accessible.

The command line syntax is as follows:

```
VNTextPatch extractlocal <folder containing original game files> script.xlsx
VNTextPatch insertlocal <folder containing original game files> script.xlsx <folder to receive patched game files>
VNTextPatch insertgdocs <folder containing original game files> <Google Docs spreadsheet identifier> <folder to receive patched game files>
```

The input folder should only contain the original scenario files. If it contains files of another format, VNTextPatch may not be able to determine the input format to use.

Depending on the game, some customization in the tool's source code may be needed. For example, Kirikiri .ks files have no uniform way of indicating character names in dialogue lines, so you may need to extend KirikiriScript.cs to make the tool aware of the method your specific game uses.

## Character name translation
After running `extractlocal`, VNTextPatch will populate a file called names.xml with all the character names it encountered. If you add translations for these names inside this file and run `extractlocal` again, the newly extracted spreadsheet will have the translated names prefilled as a convenience.

## Word wrapping
Most visual novel engines do not support automatic word wrapping. While it's sometimes possible to change their code to add this support, it's generally easier to "precalculate" the word wrapping by adding explicit line breaks in the patched game files. VNTextPatch can add these line breaks automatically for both monospace fonts (MonospaceWordWrapper.cs) and proportional fonts (ProportionalWordWrapper.cs). Both classes can be configured in VNTextPatch.exe.config. You may need to adapt the tool's source code to make it use the wrapper you want.

## Shift JIS extension
Many visual novel engines use Shift JIS (more specifically Microsoft code page 932) to encode text, meaning they can't display characters not supported by this code page. Even in English, though, there are words such as "caf√©" that contain such unsupported characters.

VNTextPatch offers a facility for solving this problem. When patching a translation into a game file, it'll detect unsupported characters, replace them by unused Shift JIS code points (so they'll be accepted by the game), and store the mapping from the unused code point to the original character inside a separate file called "sjis_ext.bin". The proxy DLL (described in the section below) will then read this file, and whenever the game renders text on screen, replace any unused code points by their corresponding original character.

This approach makes it possible to have a large number of otherwise unsupported characters - enough to, say, translate a Shift JIS game to simplified Chinese.

By default, sjis_ext.bin is created inside the output folder, next to the patched game files. You can pass a fourth argument to `insertlocal` and `insertgdocs` to specify an alternative path (which should include the file name). The proxy DLL expects the file to be in the same folder as the game .exe.

# VNTextProxy
A proxy d2d1.dll for adding proportional font support to games that normally only do monospace. It can do the following:
* Load a custom font (.ttf/.otf) from the game's folder.
* Catch calls to CreateFontA(), CreateFontIndirectA() and IDWriteFactory::CreateTextFormat() and make them use this custom font instead.
* Catch calls to TextOutA() and ID2D1RenderTarget::DrawText() and adjust the rendered character's coordinates so it'll be correctly positioned next to the preceding character. This takes into account the width of the character in the custom font, as well as any kerning.
* Replace calls to TextOutA() by TextOutW(), restoring non-Shift JIS characters in the process (see previous section).

If the game doesn't reference d2d1.dll, you can use the files from the "VersionProxy" folder to turn the DLL into a version.dll proxy instead. If the game doesn't reference version.dll either, you can use [DLLProxyGenerator](https://github.com/nitrog0d/DLLProxyGenerator/releases/tag/v1.0.0) to create proxy code for a DLL it does reference.

The source code comes with an empty "EnginePatches" class where you can add game hooks specific for the engine you're working with. Microsoft's [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) library is already included.
